# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION: *This code is inspired by the tiktok account adventuresinaardia, where he rolls a dice to create a random sandwich. It starts off by asking if the user wants to build a random sandwich and if the user inputs 1. for yes it generates one. Utilizing two APIs, this code creates a randomized sandwich with the bread, meat, cheese and a sauce.*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *Since there are a lot of variations of these items and different things (ie breading instead of bread or not specific types of cheese), sometimes the results are wonky. However, I tried renaming the searches for the APIs and they did not work. Additionally the API code for Spoonacular can only be utilized I believe 2 times before it does not work *

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS: *Thank you for teaching me so much about coding!*
