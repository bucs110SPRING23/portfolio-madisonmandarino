#CS110 Midterm Exam

#SHORT DESCRIPTION: My program randomly generates 4 different sized stars all over the screen. After, it creates a crescent moon and a city skyline that generates using different functions and for loops. 

#None.

#https://pythonturtle.academy/tutorial-drawing-crescent-moon-with-python-turtle/ (USED THIS TO EXPLAIN HOW TO MAKE A MOON)

#Only thing that is annying is generating the stars takes a while, but I didn't want it to go too fast. Because of this I kept it at a speed of 7 instead of 10. Thank you so much!
